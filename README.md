## About
This Clicky Game is a 'Friends' themed memory game, where you must click each card once in order to win. The highest score you can get is 12, and once you do, an alert will appear letting you know that you completed the game. It will then restart and reset the scores for you. However, if you accidently click the same card twice, an alert will appear that you lost the game. The game will restart and the score will reset, however, your current highscore will be maintained until you reach 12.
